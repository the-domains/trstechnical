**Jaguar F-Pace Launch **

Jaguar's new sports car entered the record books on 14 September when it took the title for performing the largest ever loop the loop in a car ever at the 2015 International Motor Show in Frankfurt, Germany. Guinness World Records said the Jaguar F-Pace driven by stunt driver Terry Grant successfully completed the 19.08m tall, 360-degree circle. Grant drove the car after two months of intense preparation, with the international pro driver having to ensure his body was ready to withstand g-force more severe than that experienced by space shuttle pilots. "The speed is critical. I need to make sure I hit the magic number to drive through the loop otherwise it's not going to be possible. So I had to concentrate on that and just calm myself down. I was probably the most calmest I have been all day when I was in there and driving down and approaching the loop," he said after performing the stunt at Frankfurt's Niederrad Racecourse.
